# map-box
I create Web App and data visualizations, with my most recent work being the development of a custom map UI built on GL JS for a UAE country.
I work Primarily in JAVASCRIPT.
Mapbox GL JS maps are dynamically rendered by combining vector tiles with style rules in the browser rather than on a server,
which makes it possible to change the map's style and displayed data in response to user interaction.
